## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences.
- Persist theme with localStorage

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Fetch API
- [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/users?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) - Modern JS date utility library

### What I learned

- Components made it easier for me to focus on one feature at a time rather.
- Make the features work first before working on the design.
- Setting the background-color of `input` to transparent works well in Firefox, but with Chrome's autocomplete, it adds a background-color. Something to work on in the future üõ†Ô∏è

```css
.search-form__input {
  width: 100%;
  color: inherit;
  font-family: inherit;
  font-size: 0.78rem;
  background-color: transparent;
  border-color: transparent;
}
```

### Continued development

Features in the Future:

- [ ] change the `border-color` of the `.search-form` if there are no results
- [ ] fix the `background-color` of the `.search-form__input` on Chrome
